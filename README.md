Explain theoretically the following terms:
1)Classes: Classes in programming, especially in object-oriented languages like C++, are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. 

Theoretically, a class defines a new data type that can have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). For example, if you have a class called Employee, it might have attributes like name, age, and position, and methods like work() or promote(). 

When you create an instance of a class, known as an object, you can use the methods and access the properties defined in the class. This allows for better organization of code and promotes reusability, as the same class can be used to create multiple objects with similar characteristics. 

In summary, classes are fundamental to structuring programs in an object-oriented way, making it easier to model real-world entities and their interactions.
2)Arrow functions: Arrow functions are a syntactical feature in JavaScript that allows you to write function expressions more concisely. Theoretically, they provide a way to create functions without the need for the function keyword, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

One of the main characteristics of arrow functions is that they do not have their own this context. Instead, they capture the this value from the surrounding lexical context, which means that when you use this inside an arrow function, it refers to the this value of the enclosing scope. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to maintain the context of this in callbacks or methods.

The syntax is also more streamlined. For instance, if you have a function that takes parameters and returns a value, you can write it in a single line without curly braces or the return keyword if it's a single expression. This makes arrow functions a popular choice for functional programming patterns in JavaScript.

In summary, arrow functions enhance the way functions are defined and used in JavaScript, making the code more concise and helping to manage the this context effectively.
3)Variables are fundamental concepts in programming that act as containers for storing data values. They allow you to label and manipulate data in your programs. 

In most programming languages, you declare a variable using a specific keyword (like var, let, or const in JavaScript, or just a type followed by the variable name in C++). Once declared, you can assign a value to the variable, which can be changed later in the program if it's not a constant.

For example, in C++, you might declare an integer variable like this:

Here, age is the variable name, and it holds the value 25. You can then use this variable in calculations, output it to the console, or modify it as needed.

Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or objects, and they play a crucial role in managing and manipulating information within your programs.
4)Array methods are functions that allow you to perform various operations on arrays in programming. In languages like JavaScript, there are several built-in array methods that can help you manipulate and interact with array data efficiently.
5)Destructuring : Destructuring is a convenient way to extract values from arrays or objects in programming, particularly in JavaScript. It allows you to unpack values into distinct variables, making your code cleaner and more readable.
